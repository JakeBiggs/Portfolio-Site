Owl-Carousel has been used for the Project Carousel element.


Originally, I was going to be using Next.js for my full stack but I decided on going for a more involved approach as I will get more into Next.js on further projects.

All my data for my jobs and projects are imported via JSON. I created my own custom JSON parser for this project which can be found at https://github.com/JakeBiggs/Custom-JSON-Parser or in  the plugins section of this repository.
